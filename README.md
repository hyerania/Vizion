## Executive Summary
The objective of this proposal is to provide a detailed description of the product our team plans to develop by December 2017. The need for this project derives from the current safety and convenience issues that are associated with how household doors are locked and unlocked. Common mistakes such as forgetting to lock the door when you leave the house cannot be resolved unless you are there yourself, and this is an issue that we believe can be made more preventable. Our team plans to account for this problem by creating a system that can lock and unlock doors through a means of telecommunication, so the owner of a property can be away from their house while still being able to manage the locks to their doors. The system will be controlled through an Android application that will be capable of direct lock control, facial recognition to identify people who are allowed in, and entrance logging to notify the user about attempts to get in.  The design will consist of multiple hardware and software components including the mechanical parts (door, deadbolt), a button, microphone, camera, lock servo, a main I/O program, a database implementation, and an Android application. Each component will serve a dedicated and unique purpose within the system. The results and benefits of this product will thus enhance both the safety and convenience of the use of the modern lock system.

## Goals and Objectives
The objectives of this project include creating a door locking/unlocking system that can:
- Lock or unlock a door through communication from an Android cell phone application.
- Use a camera to recognize the faces of people who are at the door.
- Implement a database to store facial recognition information for people of interest.
- Allow the user to specify which people the door should automatically unlock for.
- Maintain a log over a specified set of time that indicates everyone who has been to the door and everyone who has been let in.
